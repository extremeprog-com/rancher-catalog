# Git Proxy

Easy access to private repos for automation services.

Git Proxy exists to organize a painful and secure access to private repos for automation services.

## Installation
When running container specify a private key to access to repo. Public key should be added to those services which you want to provide access to. We recommend to create an additional pair for these purposes.

Within Rancher you can use it for connecting private cattles and installing services from your private repos.
